### My AI & Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey in AI and Machine Learning. I aim to understand concepts deeply, practice coding, and improve day by day. Every project, notebook, and exercise here represents a step toward mastering these topics and applying them in real-world scenarios.

# Task 1: Understanding Decision Tree Classifier

**Goal:**
To understand how a Decision Tree Classifier works using labeled examples and features.

# Task 2: Iris Flower Classification  

**Description:**  
Classifies Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using a Random Forest model. Trains on a dataset and predicts on a test set, showing accuracy.  

**Files:**  
- `Iris-Train.csv` – Training data (included)  
- `Iris-Test.csv` – Test data (included)  
- `irisdatasets_train_test.py` – Python script  
# Task 3: Linear Regression House Price

Goal:
To predict (create) a random house price based on area using a Linear Regression model and visualize the relationship.

# Task 4: Linear Regression with Train–Test Split

Goal:
To train a Linear Regression model using house area and price data, evaluate its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score, and visualize both the training and testing results with a regression line.

# Task 5: Multiple Feature House Price Prediction with Scaling

Goal:
To predict house prices using multiple features (area, number of bedrooms, and house age) with a Linear Regression model, applying feature scaling (StandardScaler) to improve model performance before training and prediction.

# Task 6: Multiple Feature Linear Regression with Error Evaluation

Goal:
To train a Linear Regression model using multiple house features and evaluate its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) by comparing actual and predicted house prices.

# Task 7 : Polynomial Regression for Non-Linear Data

Goal:
To model and visualize a non-linear relationship between input and output using Polynomial Regression (degree 2) by transforming features and fitting a Linear Regression model on the transformed data.
