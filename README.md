### My AI & Machine Learning Learning Journey

This repository is dedicated to documenting my learning journey in AI and Machine Learning. I aim to understand concepts deeply, practice coding, and improve day by day. Every project, notebook, and exercise here represents a step toward mastering these topics and applying them in real-world scenarios.

# Task 1: Understanding Decision Tree Classifier

**Goal:**
To understand how a Decision Tree Classifier works using labeled examples and features.

# Task 2: Iris Flower Classification  

**Description:**  
Classifies Iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) using a Random Forest model. Trains on a dataset and predicts on a test set, showing accuracy.  

**Files:**  
- `Iris-Train.csv` – Training data (included)  
- `Iris-Test.csv` – Test data (included)  
- `irisdatasets_train_test.py` – Python script
